1- we instlled opencv library and cropped images using it
2- we iterated through dataset folder and created a clean folder of cropped images
3- we are now doing feature engineering to extract features from images using wavelet transform 
4- we converted raw image to wavelet image and stacked it vertically
5- after data cleaning 
6- train our model in svm
7- grid search to try different models and select the best
8- save trained model
9- save class dictionary
